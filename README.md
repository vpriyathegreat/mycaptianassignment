Thank you for asking for my feedback on my UI progress. I feel fairly comfortable with the UI, and my code understanding is strong. Iâ€™m confident in handling smaller bug fixes, but I think I need more practice to build full confidence, as most of my recent tasks have been backend-focused. To improve further, I would like to take up more frontend-related JIRAs, particularly feature-building ones, as I believe this will help me better understand the flow and strengthen my skills.
