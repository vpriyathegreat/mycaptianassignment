Subject: My Progress on UI

Hello Sanjeevi,

Regarding my progress on the UI:

I feel fairly comfortable with the UI and my code understanding is strong. I am confident in handling smaller bug fixes.

Since most of my recent tasks have been backend-focused, I would like to take up more frontend-related JIRAs, especially feature-building ones, to strengthen my overall understanding and confidence in the UI flow.


Regards,
Vishnu Priya
